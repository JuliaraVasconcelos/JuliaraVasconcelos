### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ I'm Juliara Vasconcelos from Brazil. I've started my learning journey in front end development this year but I've already have a lot to show. 
My first contact with this field was in 2009 when I used to make templates for Tumblr Pages only using HTML and CSS (and eventually bootstrap, when I discovered it).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS but always go back to remember the fundamentals

ðŸ“« You can find me at:

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Product Designer who loves japanese culture!
